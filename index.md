# About me

My name is Dieuwke, I am a PhD student at the <a href="http://illc.uva.nl" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Institute for Logic, Language and Computation</font></a>, under supervision of <a href="http://wzuidema.humanities.uva.nl/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Willem Zuidema</font></a>. 
I am employed within the the <a href="https://www.languageininteraction.nl/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Language in Interaction</font></a> project since July 2015.

Although I am generally interested in many aspects of language, in my thesis I am developing (computational) neural network models for (semantic) parsing, a problem that for me touches on the core of understanding natural language.
Although artificial neural networks are of course nothing like the real brain, I hope that understanding the principles by which they can encode processes can still teach us something that will lead to a better understanding of how language could be implemented by the brain.   

In my free time I am also sometimes occupied with language, as I love learning new languages.
I am also a pretty fanatic sports girl (playing, not watching) and I like playing the piano.
