# About me

My name is Dieuwke, I am working as a PhD student at the <a href="http://illc.uva.nl" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Institute for Logic, Language and Computation</font></a>, under supervision of <a href="http://wzuidema.humanities.uva.nl/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Willem Zuidema</font></a>. I am employed within the the <a href="https://www.languageininteraction.nl/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Language in Interaction</font></a> project, and I am working on computational models of natural language (processing) that are inspired by the brain. In my free time I like playing the piano, learning new languages and playing sports.
