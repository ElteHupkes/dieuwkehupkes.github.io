My name is Dieuwke, I am a PhD student at the <a href="http://illc.uva.nl" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Institute for Logic, Language and Computation</font></a>, under supervision of <a href="http://wzuidema.humanities.uva.nl/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Willem Zuidema</font></a>. 
I am employed within the the <a href="https://www.languageininteraction.nl/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Language in Interaction</font></a> project since July 2015.

I started my journey in academia studying physics, but at some point I had to admit that although I think physics is very interesting and I love abstract systems, my true passion is really the beautifully complex system that is natural language.
Ever since I can remember I have loved thinking about structures in language, which I always found to be so generic on the one hand but so specific and restricted on the other.
While doing a master in Logic at the University of Amsterdam I was very lucky to discover the field of computational linguistics (and in particular syntactic parsing).
I am still very glad that I got the chance to do a job that allows me try to find answers to the questions that intrigue me most.

Currently, in my PhD work, I focus on (artificial) neural network models for (semantic) parsing, a problem that for me touches on the core of understanding natural language.
Although artificial neural networks are of course nothing like the real brain, I hope that understanding the principles by which they can encode processes can still teach us something that will lead to a better understanding of how language could be implemented in the brain.   

In my free time, I still spend quite a substantial amount of my time thinking about language and learning new ones.
I am also a pretty fanatic pole dancer (participating in competitions with my duo partner) and I like playing the piano.
